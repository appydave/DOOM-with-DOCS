# DOOM BSP Traversal and Line Segment Rendering System

## Overview
This file (`r_bsp.c`) is a crucial part of DOOM's rendering engine that handles Binary Space Partition (BSP) traversal and processes line segments for rendering. It determines which walls are visible to the player and manages the clipping of wall segments to the view frustum.

## Key Concepts

### BSP Tree
- A binary space partition tree divides the game world into convex subspaces
- Used for efficient rendering and determining which walls are visible from the player's position
- Enables front-to-back rendering order which is crucial for proper occlusion

### Segments and Clipping
- Line segments represent visible wall sections
- The code maintains a "clip list" that tracks which portions of the screen are already occupied by walls
- Prevents drawing walls that are hidden behind other walls

## Major Components

### Global Variables
- `drawsegs`: Array storing all drawable wall segments
- `solidsegs`: Array tracking screen areas occupied by solid walls
- `curline`, `sidedef`, `linedef`: Current line segment being processed
- `frontsector`, `backsector`: Sectors on either side of current wall

### Key Functions

#### R_ClearDrawSegs
Initializes the drawsegs array for a new frame.

#### R_ClipSolidWallSegment
Handles solid (one-sided) walls:
- Takes a screen-space range (first to last column)
- Updates clip list to mark areas as occupied
- Stores visible wall segments for rendering

#### R_ClipPassWallSegment
Handles transparent (two-sided) walls like windows:
- Similar to solid wall clipping but doesn't modify clip list
- Allows walls behind to be visible through openings

#### R_AddLine
Main line segment processing:
- Determines if a wall segment is visible
- Handles backface culling
- Clips segment to view frustum
- Routes to appropriate clipping function

#### R_RenderBSPNode
Core BSP traversal function:
- Recursively walks the BSP tree
- Determines which side of BSP partition player is on
- Ensures correct front-to-back rendering order

## Technical Details

### Clipping Process
1. Each wall segment is converted to screen-space coordinates
2. Checked against existing clip list
3. Visible portions are stored for rendering
4. Clip list updated for solid walls

### View Frustum
- Defined by `clipangle`
- Segments outside view angles are quickly rejected
- Prevents processing of walls behind the player

## Conclusion
This code forms the backbone of DOOM's revolutionary rendering system. It efficiently determines visibility and manages the drawing order of walls, creating the game's distinctive 3D perspective from 2D map data.
