# DOOM Network Communication Module (d_net.c)

## Overview
This file implements DOOM's network game communication and protocol handling, focusing on the OS-independent parts. It manages the synchronization of game states between different players in a multiplayer game.

## Key Concepts

### Network Communication Structure
- Uses a client-server model where one player acts as the host
- Implements packet-based communication between nodes (players)
- Handles game state synchronization through "tics" (game update cycles)

### Important Data Structures
- `doomcom_t`: Main communication structure
- `doomdata_t`: Structure for actual game data packets
- `ticcmd_t`: Contains player input commands for each game tic

## Major Functions

### NetUpdate()
The central networking function that:
- Builds new command inputs for the console player
- Sends packets to other nodes
- Receives and processes incoming packets
- Maintains network synchronization

### HSendPacket()
Handles sending packets to other nodes:
- Calculates packet checksums
- Adds appropriate flags
- Manages packet transmission

### HGetPacket()
Receives packets from the network:
- Validates packet checksums
- Handles packet size verification
- Processes incoming game data

### GetPackets()
Processes received packets:
- Handles player join/leave events
- Manages game state synchronization
- Deals with packet retransmission requests

### D_ArbitrateNetStart()
Coordinates game start between players:
- Shares initial game settings
- Ensures all players are ready
- Synchronizes game parameters

## Network Synchronization
The code uses several mechanisms to maintain game synchronization:
- Tic-based timing system
- Packet retransmission for lost data
- Checksum verification
- Player state tracking

## Error Handling
- Implements various checks for packet validity
- Handles network timeouts
- Manages player disconnections
- Provides debug logging capabilities

## Technical Details
- Maximum players: Defined by MAXPLAYERS
- Backup tics: Maintains history of game states
- Network commands: Uses flag-based system (NCMD_*)
- Checksums: Ensures data integrity

## Conclusion
This module forms the backbone of DOOM's multiplayer functionality, handling all network communication while maintaining game synchronization across different players. It uses a robust system of tics and checksums to ensure consistent gameplay across the network.
