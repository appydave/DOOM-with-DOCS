# DOOM Renderer: Wall Segment Drawing (r_segs.c)

## Overview
This file is a critical part of DOOM's rendering engine, specifically handling the drawing of wall segments. It contains code that determines how walls are drawn, including their textures, lighting, and visibility calculations. This is part of DOOM's innovative pseudo-3D rendering system.

## Key Concepts for Non-C Programmers
Before diving into the specifics, here are some important concepts:
- **Fixed-point Numbers**: DOOM uses fixed-point arithmetic for precise calculations without floating-point math
- **Segments**: Pieces of walls that need to be drawn
- **Textures**: Image data that gets mapped onto walls
- **Clipping**: Determining which parts of walls are visible and should be drawn

## Global Variables
Important global variables include:
- `segtextured`: Indicates if any textures might be visible
- `markfloor`, `markceiling`: Track if floor/ceiling planes need marking
- `maskedtexture`: Indicates presence of a see-through texture
- `toptexture`, `bottomtexture`, `midtexture`: Different wall texture positions

## Main Functions

### R_RenderMaskedSegRange
**Purpose**: Renders wall segments that have transparent or semi-transparent parts
- Parameters: 
  - `ds`: Drawseg structure containing segment information
  - `x1`, `x2`: Start and end screen coordinates
- Handles lighting calculations and texture mapping for masked (transparent) wall sections

### R_RenderSegLoop
**Purpose**: Core rendering loop for wall segments
- Draws wall segments pixel by pixel
- Handles multiple texture tiers (top, middle, bottom)
- Manages ceiling and floor marking
- Calculates lighting and texture coordinates

### R_StoreWallRange
**Purpose**: Prepares wall segment data for rendering
- Parameters:
  - `start`, `stop`: Screen pixel range to draw
- Calculates:
  - Wall scaling and distance
  - Texture boundaries
  - Lighting levels
  - Floor/ceiling markings

## Technical Details
The code uses several advanced rendering techniques:
1. Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) for determining draw order
2. Fixed-point math for performance
3. Texture mapping with perspective correction
4. Dynamic lighting calculations

## Conclusion
This file represents a crucial part of DOOM's rendering pipeline, handling the complex task of drawing walls with proper perspective, lighting, and texturing. It's a testament to the innovative techniques used to create 3D-like graphics on 1990s hardware.
